# Week 1

This week we'll focus on some fundamental topics.
[Complexity analysis](materials/complexity_analysis.md) will help us compare
two algorithms with respect to their performance as the input grows.
[Linear data structures](materials/linear_data_structures.md) are the base
for most of the algorithms that we'll be studying in the next few lectures.

Next we'll look at [sorting](materials/sorting.md). A crucial problem in
algorithm design and analysis with many different solutions. We'll study
several algorithms that produced a sorted sequence of elements out of unsorted.
This will give us knowledge about handy techniques that we can apply in other
situations.

## Tasks

1. [Vector](1-Vector/README.md) - Implement the `Vector` data structure.
1. [Queue](2-Queue/README.md) - Implement the `Queue` data structure using `List`.
1. [Stack](3-Stack/README.md) - Implement the `Stack` data structure using `Queue`.
