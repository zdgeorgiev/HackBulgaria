# Algo-1
The first edition of the algo course in Hack Bulgaria

## Course Program

**This program is a draft version and can change until the course starts.**

* Basic linear data structures recap - stack, queue.
* Basic non-linear data structures recap - Binary Search Trees / Trie / Heaps
* Heapsort. Heap as a data structure.
* Graph algorithms - BFS / DFS / Dijkstra / Spanning Trees / Matching algorithms
* [String-search algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_searching_algorithm) - Knuth–Morris–Pratt, Hash, Aho-Corasick?
* Probability algorithms - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm
* Dynamic Programming - DNA stuff
